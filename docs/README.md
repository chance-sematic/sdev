## What is Sematic?

Sematic is an easy-to-use, lightweight development toolkit for Machine Learning (ML), Data Science (DS), or other workloads.

It aims to accelerate the prototyping, reporting, and productionization of ML and DS workflows by abstracting away many infrastructure details and bringing forth higher-level semantics.

Sematic's features include:

* An extremely lightweight Python SDK to define nestable and dynamic computational workflows
* Almost-static and runtime type checking
* Execution backends: local and soon remote
* A semantic UI to monitor, inspect, and share pipelines and their artifacts
* End-to-end lineage tracking of all artifacts and assets for reproducibility and traceability
