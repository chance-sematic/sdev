# Sematic concepts

## Principles

* **Minimalism**: the concepts or primitives of a piece of software are its eigenvector. They should be chosen so as to minimize their number. Each new concept is a new degree of freedom, and with that comes more entropy, and therefore more bugs and problems.

* **Simplicity**: If a concept cannot be explained in one line, it is likely too complex and tries to represent multiple things at once.

* **Consistency**: In order to guarantee expectability (i.e. no surprises), we
  try to enforce consistency as much as possible. This reduces tribal knowledge
  and corner cases.
