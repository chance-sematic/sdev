# Company Handbook

## Company
### Our Story
Sematic was founded by Emmanuel and Jai in June 2022. We met at their first day working at Cruise (self-driving cars) in San Francisco. At Cruise we worked on ML Infrastructure, and together with a great team, developed tools which enabled Cruise's Continuous Learning Machine.

Inspired by our work at Cruise, we applied to YC in Summer 2022 with an idea to develop an open-source developer toolkit for developers to easily create and manage continuous learning machines. However, after talking to many Data Scientists and ML Engineers in the community, we discovered that this was a problem it was experienced by more advanced companies. Instead, we aspired to build a lightweight product to help empower smaller Data Science teams to tinker with and productionize ML easily.

At the same time, we noticed that most Data Scientists still rely on Notebooks for the early stages of ML they want to productionize. While we are big fans of Notebooks for exploratory work and tinkering, we felt that the gap from a Notebook to production code is a big leap. We decided to focus on the middle-ground, a way for Data Scientists and ML Engineers to prototype with a fun, collaborative and interactive experience while having a gradual process to reach a production pipeline.

### June - August 2022 (Alpha / Prototype)
In the next few months we are releasing our alpha. We are focused on two things: building the initial product with barebones functionality and listening to Data Scientists and ML Engineers.
