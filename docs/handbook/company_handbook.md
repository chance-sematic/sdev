# Company Handbook ðŸ¦Š

Welcome to Sematic's company handbook.

Here you'll find everything about our company: why we started, culture, values, strategy and roadmap.

Transparency and open cultures is one of our core values, which is why we make this handbook and its processes, our technology and source code available to the public. We see transparency as a way to involve the community to work together to solve problems.

We also like to share ideas early and often with our community, so we can iterate faster to get better results. 

This handbook is not a static document, it will change as we learn more and grow together. We'll keep it up to date as much as possible, and it exists alongside our main code base on Github for that reason. Occasionally you will see that some pages are still in draft, which we will label appropriately.

Feedback on the handbook is encouraged.

## Company
### Our Story

Sematic was founded by Emmanuel and Jai in June 2022. We met on our first day working at Cruise (self-driving cars) in San Francisco. At Cruise we worked on ML Infrastructure, and together with a great team, developed tools that enabled Cruise's Continuous Learning Machine.

Inspired by our learnings, we applied to YC in Summer 2022 with the idea to develop an open-source developer toolkit for developers to easily create and manage continuous learning machines. However, after talking to many Data Scientists and ML Engineers in the community, we discovered that this problem was experienced by more advanced companies. Instead, we aspired to build a lightweight product to help empower smaller Data Science teams to tinker with and productionize ML easily.

At the same time, we made two broad observations: Data Scientists still rely on Notebooks for the early stages of ML even for production and second many ML teams were attempting to apply new models on their own data, and struggling to scale to new use cases, regions quick enough to meet business deadlines. We set out to help in these areas. While we are big fans of Notebooks for exploratory work and tinkering, we felt that the gap from a Notebook to production code is a big leap. We decided to focus on the middle-ground, a way for Data Scientists and ML Engineers to prototype with a fun, collaborative, and interactive experience while allowing a faster pathway to production ML, in a way that is non-intrusive and lightweight.

### June - August 2022 (Alpha / Prototype)

In this period we are focused on two things: building the initial product with barebones functionality and listening to Data Scientists and ML Engineers.

## Culture and Values

## Strategy

We want to help companies prototype and productionize ML easier: we believe it should be fun, collaborative and easy to scale.

* *Fun and fast:* we believe you should be able to iterate with as close to vanilla Python and SQL as possible.

* *Easy to collaborate collaborate:* a core part of ML is easy access to visualize your models, metrics and share to others for comments/feedback prior to releases and keep track of all your releases and learnings over time.

* *Easier to scale:* a more seamless transition from a working prototype to a reliable production pipeline, that can help you speed up deployments as you learn from customer feedback and improve your data over time, as well as create new pipelines for new use cases and domains.
